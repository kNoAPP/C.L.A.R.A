# [Version] Configuration version, ignore unless you like breaking things.

# [Enable] [MySQL_Bungee] Enabling MySQL_Bungee will unlock a lot of hidden stuff in Clara.
# Clara will be able to keep track of which servers are online and
# will move players off a closing server. However, both MySQL and
# Bungee are required to use this.

# [MySQL] Enter your MySQL details here.

# [Bungee] Provide a path to your Bungee config.yml file.
# Example: /home/Bungee/config.yml

# [RestorePlayersToServers] Only relavent on servers using MySQL_Bungee. Should Clara bring
# players who were kicked off another server back if the server comes
# back online?
